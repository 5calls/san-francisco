Data for san francisco supervisors, used for local calls at 5calls.org

Based on the current legislators format at https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/, and sourced from https://sfbos.org/roster-members

Other notes:
- Currently there are no historical entries for supervisor terms, it might be interesting to have this data eventually
- Unlike Congress' bioguide, there are no clear unique identifiers that SF uses for supervisors, we've provided a name-based id that is enough for 5 Calls and a wikipedia id for more general information, but something more exact would be worthwhile.
